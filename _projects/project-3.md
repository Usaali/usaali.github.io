In February 2024 i attended the [Robotics Vision Summer School (RVSS)](https://www.rvss.org.au/) at the Kioloa Coastal Campus of the Australian National University. It was a great experience as the Campus is very isolated and surrounded by nature.

There were many great speakers like Peter Corke (QUT), Jen Jen Chung (UQ), Donald Dansereau (USYD), Teresa Vidal Calleja (UTS) and many more. The whole week was filled with interesting lectures, workshops and social events, making the time pass by very quickly. I learned a lot about Visual Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks and other topics. Also there were A LOT of Kangaroos, making the whole summer school even more enjoyable!

At the end of the summer school there was a competition, where teams had to design and train a neural network to keep a small robot on a track. The track was modular and only revealed in the end, making it a challenge to create a robust network and applying the things learned in lectures and workshops during the week. All in all it was a great experience!
