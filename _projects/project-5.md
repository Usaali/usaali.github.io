The [Robothon Challenge](https://automatica-munich.com/en/munich-i/robothon/) is a competition hosted by the Technical University Munich and tackles the problem of E-Waste recycling. The goal is to try and bring more automation into the whole recycling chain as a lot of things are still done by manual labor. Teams are handed out a task board and need to solve the tasks on it autonomously with no intervention from the human. They are allowed to use any robot arm for it and we used the Universal Robots UR5e. Apart from the task board, a transferability task needs to be presented. For that we chose to measure an old computer and detect faults. Then our solution could take out and put in new RAM or a GPU to fix the detected faults. As we had the fastest solution for the task board and could convince the jury of our transferability task, we won the first place in 2023!
