I finished my Master of Engineering at Technische Hochschule WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt in April 2024 with the highest possible grade (1.0) and am currently working as a researcher at the [Center for Robotics](https://robotik.thws.de/en/) in Schweinfurt. My current research focus is the environment representation in Human-Robot-Collaboration scenarios. I have a strong foundation in programming (mainly C, C++, Python and Matlab), as well as hardware design (Altium, Eagle and KiCad) and embedded systems (STM and Atmega). Currently i am working on expanding my skillset to machine learning (using Tensorflow and PyBullet).

During my bachelor's thesis I worked on evaluating the [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) algorithm for an autonomous drone, igniting my passion for robotics. This lead me to join the masters program at the Center for Robotics in Schweinfurt. 
<!-- The [KOPRO](https://www.thws.de/en/research/institutes/idee/completed-idee-projects/kopro/) project that i was part of focused on making Human-Robot-Collaboration more accessible for industrial assembly usecases.  -->
My master's thesis explored the use of an environment model to enable real-time interactions with an human worker. My final semester I spent abroad in Australia, working at the [University of Technology Sydney (UTS)](https://www.uts.edu.au/). There i had the chance to do some research at the [UTS Robotics Institute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute) and be part of the [Australian Cobotics Centre (ACC)](https://www.australiancobotics.org/). I also took part in the [Robotics Vision Summer School (RVSS)](https://www.rvss.org.au/).

Together with the australian researchers i developed a framework called [IDMP](https://uts-ri.github.io/IDMP/) which we open-sourced. We submitted this work to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), where it is currently under review. As a Researcher at the THWS I am working on leveraging IDMP together with [Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02854) to facilitate safe reactive motion planning in Human-Robot-Collaboration scenarios. In July 2024 I presented this work in the [RSS Workshop on Semantics for Robotics](https://www.dynsyslab.org/rss24-workshop-on-semantics-for-robotics/) at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) Conference in Delft. I am going to present another paper about this at the [ICRA@40](https://icra40.ieee.org/) in Rotterdam.

I also enjoy taking part in competitions and challenges. I have been an active member of the Robocup Small-Size league team [ERFORCE](https://www.robotics-erlangen.de/en/) since 2017. There we build and program soccer robots to compete against other teams at a global scale. I have mostly been working on the electronics (pcb design and layouting) and the firmware. Apart from that i took part in the [Robothon Challenge](https://automatica-munich.com/en/munich-i/robothon/) twice, winning 4th place in 2022 and 1st place in 2023.
